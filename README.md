CyberGIS Styles (cybergis-styles)
================

## Description

This repository contains styles for use in the CyberGIS.

See the guides in the cybergis-guides repo at [https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-guides/](https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-guides), for examples on use of these styles.

### CyberGIS
The Humanitarian Information Unit has been developing a sophisticated geographic computing infrastructure referred to as the CyberGIS. The CyberGIS provides highly available, scalable, reliable, and timely geospatial services capable of supporting multiple concurrent projects.  The CyberGIS relies on primarily open source projects, such as PostGIS, GeoServer, GDAL, GeoGit, OGR, and OpenLayers.  The name CyberGIS is dervied from the term geospatial cyberinfrastructure.

### ROGUE
The Rapid Opensource Geospatial User-Driven Enterprise (ROGUE) Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) is a two-year research & development project developing the technology for distributed geographic data creation and synchronization in a disconnected environement.  This new technology taken altogether is referred to as GeoSHAPE.  See [http://geoshape.org](http://geoshape.org) for more information.  HIU is leveraging the technology developed through ROGUE to build out the CyberGIS into a robust globally distributed infrastruture.

## Installation

These installation instructions are subject to change.  Right now, since there are non-debian package dependencies, you can really extract the repo to whatever directory you want.  The instructions below are suggested as they mirror Linux best practices for external packages.

As root, execute the following commands:
```
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-styles.git cybergis-styles.git
```

The CyberGIS Styles repo (cybergis-styles) also contains some tools for automating the process of creating styles.  See the installation guide at [https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-scripts](https://github.com/state-hiu/cybergis-scripts).
